![Doodles](images/img_1846.jpg "mapping thoughts to patterns ")

Twenty years ago I spent my university lectures drawing doodles instead of writing notes, and I could tell by the looks I got that this was not how things were done. At that time I didn't know why, but I knew that it worked. I was able to infuse the lines I drew with the essence of the lecture, and the content would remain in memory through the act of drawing.

At first I assumed it was just a way for me to concentrate, to channel all the attention towards the spoken word (just the way reading comics when eating your lunch made you appreciate the food more when you were 8). More recently I have realised that what I was doing was more akin to a process of mapping thoughts to patterns
